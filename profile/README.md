# Welcome to the AWS CLI Tools GitHub Organization

This organization is home to a collection of open-source Command Line Interface (CLI) tools specifically designed for Amazon Web Services (AWS).

The main goal of these tools is to enhance the performance and speed of the existing AWS CLI tools. This is accomplished by re-engineering these tools using the Rust programming language, known for its performance benefits and memory safety.

## Guiding Principles

Here are the fundamental principles that guide the design and implementation of our CLI tools:

* **Each Program Does One Thing Well**: Following the Unix philosophy, we design our CLI tools to do one thing and do it well. This principle encourages the creation of simple, robust, and composable tools that can be chained together to solve more complex problems.

* **Speed**: The performance of our CLI tools is a top priority. By leveraging the speed of the Rust programming language, we aim to provide CLI tools that execute tasks quickly and efficiently.

* **Interoperability**: We design our CLI tools to be interoperable with other tools. The output of our tools is designed to be easily consumed by other CLI tools, making it easy to integrate our tools into existing workflows and pipelines.
