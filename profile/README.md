# Welcome to the AWS CLI Tools GitHub Organization

This organization is home to a collection of open-source Command Line Interface (CLI) tools specifically designed for Amazon Web Services (AWS).

The main goal of these tools is to enhance the performance and speed of the existing AWS CLI tools. This is accomplished by re-engineering these tools using the Rust programming language, known for its performance benefits and memory safety.
